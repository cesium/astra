# Astra Component Library

Welcome to the Astra project Storybook. This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide for developers working with our component library and design system.

## Overview

This Storybook instance showcases all available components, their variations, and implementation guidelines.

## What is Storybook?

Storybook is a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in isolation. It provides a development environment where you can:

- Build components independently from your application
- Ensure visual consistency across your project

## Getting Started

### Browsing Components

Navigate through the sidebar to explore different component categories:

- **Foundation**: Basic design tokens and utilities
- **Components**: Interactive UI elements
- **Patterns**: Complex component compositions
- **Templates**: Page-level layouts and structures

## Contributing

When adding new components:

- Follow the established naming conventions
- Include comprehensive documentation
- Provide multiple usage examples
- Ensure accessibility compliance

For detailed contribution guidelines, refer to the project repository documentation.
